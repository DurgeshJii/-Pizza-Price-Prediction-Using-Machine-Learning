# 🍕Pizza-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict pizza prices based on multiple features such as company, diameter, topping, variant, size, and extra add-ons.  The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature enggi, model training, evaluation, and deploy via a GUI application.

# 📌 Key Features

Cleaned and preprocessed raw pizza dataset

Performed univariate analysis & visualization

Handled outliers to improve model performance

Applied Label Encoding for categorical features

# Trained and compared multiple ML models:

Linear Regression

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Evaluated models using R² Score

Identified feature importance

Saved the best model using Joblib

Built a Tkinter GUI for real-time price prediction

# 📊 Best Model Performance

Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the highest R² score (~0.89)

XGBoost also performed competitively with strong feature importance insights

# 🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Tkinter (GUI)

Joblib
